/**
The provided input file does not cover this requirement:
- A maximum of 3 loads can be performed per day, regardless of amount

only 4 patients have more than 3 loads a day and the above requirement is always hidden by this requirement:
- A maximum of $5,000 can be loaded per day

you can confirm this by checking out the commit that this comment was check in on and run the acceptance_test
On this commit, there is no logic checking for the 3 load per day limit. But there will be no failures
and everything will pass.

I've not modified the provided input.txt nor made a new file. Such a file should be easy to construct. And a
test in limit_test covers this scenario to ensure that this application produces the correct output
