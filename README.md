# my_first_go_program

### Please go easy on me. This is literally my first Go Program. Hopefully I didn't do too many thing against convention. 
### Many things in this repo are less than ideal. I will be adding some comments that will show up in a code review if I were to review this code. But at least this code produces the correct results.
